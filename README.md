# JavaScript Projects – Midterm & Final  
This repository contains two major JavaScript/HTML/CSS projects completed for my Web Programming course. Each project demonstrates different core front-end development skills including DOM manipulation, user input handling, mathematical calculations, conditional logic, form validation, and dynamic updates to the webpage.
